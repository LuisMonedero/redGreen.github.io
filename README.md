  It is important to notice that if we dont write any name on the field, we wont be able to play the game.
  Once we write the name player we want to use, we can press the 'Play' button, this will lead us to the Game view.


  
  *Before we navigate there, the app will check in his indexed DB if this player was created in this same device. 
  If so, it will load his previous game at the same point he left it. If not, we will just create a new game.*
